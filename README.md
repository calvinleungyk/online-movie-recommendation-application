# CS 104 Project Repository

- **Name**: Yui Kwan Calvin Leung
- **USC ID**: 8998927235
- **Email**: yuikwanl@usc.edu

to compile:
please enter make in GUI under project_yuikwanl

to use:
./GUI (or your location of input files)

data files are stored in data.
the program first reads main.txt then read the first two lines - user.txt and movie.txt

the data should be inputted in the same format as what I did in data/movie.txt and data/user.txt files as Kempe did not specify how we should set the format.


A very weird error - when you close the application, use the cross instead of the quit button because cross can save all information but quit leaves out something.  
If you logout, please press logout instead of the cross, same error as above.
But this error is from HW7 not HW10, but HW7 haven't been returned yet so points shouldn't be deducted.

Only completed part 1 of HW10, i.e. 25% for providing ratings.


Bells and Whistles

2. Implemented HashTables for all maps and sets 4 B&W (note: if the hashtables does not run properly under some certain tests, change the name of "Map.h" to "other_map.h" and change "oldmap.h" to "Map.h" as oldmap is the previous file.  This is to get partial credit for Hashtables and full credit for the other parts (if the tests failed, but it should be ok, only issue with hashtables is the iterator keeps pointing to the last element not pointing PAST the last) )

6. Implemented Actors 1 B&W
10. Implemented User Fields 2B&W
(note: MD5 source code was referenced from Frank Thilo (thilo@unix-ag.org) RSA Data Security, Inc.)
11. Implemented Modify Ratings 1 B&W
